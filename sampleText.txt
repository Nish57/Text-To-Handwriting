It is misleading to have just my name on the cover. I could not have
written a book like this without the help of a lot of people. I wouldd like to
thank my publisher, Bill Pollock, my editors, Laurel Chun, Leslie Shen,
Greg Poulos, Jennifer Griffith Delgado, and Frances Saux, and the rest
of the staff at No Starch Press for their invaluable help. Thanks to my
tech reviewers, Ari Lacenski and Philip James, for great suggestions,
edits, and support.
Many thanks to everyone at the Python Software Foundation for
their great work. The Python community is the best one I have found in
the tech industry.
Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends, and the gang at
Shotwell for not minding the busy life I have had while writing this
book. Cheers!
